#   - Roster 1's played player: small actual stat line, much bigger
#     pregame projection -- Projected must use the SMALL actual
#     number, not the bigger projection, once that player has played.
#     Roster 5: nobody has ANY actual stats yet (full pregame roster) --
#     Actual mode must show a flat 0 for it while Projected still
#     shows a real, nonzero projected total (the fallback path when
#     nobody's played).
#   - Roster 3's played player is having a blowout: actual stats far
#     exceed the pregame projection -- Projected must use the BIG

# "status" string (e.g. "pre_game"). buildTeamGameSchedule checks
# metadata.is_over / metadata.is_in_progress first and falls back to the
# top-level fields, so these fixtures exercise the metadata path since
# that's what production traffic actually returns.
