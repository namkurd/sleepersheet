// Standalone unit test for rumbles.html's QB-injury manager-marker tooltip
// wording (buildQbAdjTooltipHtml), run directly with
// `node test/test_qb_adj_tooltip.js` -- no browser, no fixtures, no
// server needed.
//
// Why this exists as its own thing rather than living inside run_test.py's
// Playwright fixture: the "a replacement QB is ALSO injured mid-game"
// chain scenario needs its own NFL team + backup(s) with their own
// injury_status, and threading that through make_fixtures.py's
// roster_players/matchups/stats/players plumbing without disturbing
// roster 6's existing (heavily asserted-against) Alex/Kyler-Murray/
// Carson-Wentz fixture, or any other roster's already-passing checks,
// is a lot of fixture surface for what's really pure string-building
// logic with no DOM/live-fetch involvement at all. Instead, this file
// regex-extracts buildQbAdjTooltipHtml (and the small helpers it calls --
// isOutStatus, joinNamesForSentence, escapeHtml) straight out of
// rumbles.html's real source and evals them in isolation, so what's
// tested is the actual shipped code, not a hand-copied reimplementation
// that could quietly drift from it. The single-backup, no-chain case is
// still covered end-to-end by run_test.py's Playwright scenario (Alex's
// tooltip) -- this file covers the chain branches that scenario doesn't
// exercise.
