"""Unit tests for build_rumbles.py's scoring math -- no network access,
no Playwright/browser needed. Run directly: `python3 test/test_build_rumbles.py`

Covers the `custom_points` commissioner-override handling (official_points /
score_week): a roster's OFFICIAL score for a week is `custom_points` when
Sleeper has one set (a manual override), falling back to the plain
calculated `points` otherwise -- and that this correctly flows through to
PF, PA (the opponent's "points against"), H2H win/loss, and the
vs.-the-field outscored/outscored-by counts, not just the raw score field.

This regression-tests a real bug report: the league's commissioner
manually overrode roster 6's Week 1 score from 140.61 to 160.08 (+19.47,
a custom house-rule bonus) via Sleeper's `custom_points` field, which the
page was previously ignoring entirely (reading only `points`), silently
understating that roster's PF, their opponent's PA, AND -- less obviously
-- how many other teams they'd actually outscored that week.
