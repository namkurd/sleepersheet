// Standalone unit test for rumbles.html's in-progress-player blending
// logic (blendedProjection / effectiveRemainingFraction), run directly
// with `node test/test_blended_projection.js` -- no browser, no fixtures,
// no server needed.
//
// Why this exists as its own thing rather than living inside run_test.py's
// Playwright fixture: rumbles.html's whole <script> is one top-level IIFE
// (see its "(function () { ... })();" wrapper), so blendedProjection and
// effectiveRemainingFraction are private to that closure and can't be
// called from outside it. Exercising them through the full fixture would
// mean threading a real in-progress DEF starter through
// make_fixtures.py's roster_players/starters/roster_positions plumbing,
// which several OTHER already-passing assertions (hand-verified PF
// numbers, tooltip slot ordering) depend on the exact current shape of --
// a real risk of an unrelated regression for a check that doesn't need a
// browser at all. Instead, this file regex-extracts just those two pure,
// self-contained functions (plus the two constants they use) straight out
// of rumbles.html's real source and evals them in isolation, so what's
// tested is the actual shipped code, not a hand-copied reimplementation
// that could quietly drift from it.
