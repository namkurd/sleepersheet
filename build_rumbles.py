build_rumbles.py

Computes the DTF Club "Rumbles" standings for the CURRENT season and writes
rumbles_history.json, which rumbles.html loads for everything already
finished before it takes over with live, client-side computation for the
current in-progress week.

Rumbles formula (verified against the "2026 TRUE STANDINGS" Google Sheet,
Week 1, exact match for all 12 managers):
    +9 Rumbles for winning your scheduled head-to-head matchup
    +1 Rumble for every OTHER team in the league you outscore that week
In a 12-team league that's up to 9 + 11 = 20 Rumbles in a single week.

Rumbles is a single-SEASON stat and resets each year, so this script only
ever scores weeks from the current season, and only weeks that are fully
complete -- the live/in-progress week is handled entirely in the browser
by rumbles.html (which also references Sleeper's own live-updating,
in-game player projections while games are underway, not just pregame
projections -- see rumbles.html for that logic).

This is a fully standalone project -- a separate repo from the career H2H
matrix project, with no dependency on it. League discovery and manager
display names are both derived at runtime from Sleeper's API (see
discover_current_league_id / build_manager_map below); edit
FALLBACK_LEAGUE_ID / FALLBACK_USERNAME / DISPLAY_NAME_OVERRIDES for your
own league.

# Custom rule: QB-injury backup-points adjustment
#
# House rule: if a manager's STARTED quarterback is ruled out mid-game and a
# backup QB from the same NFL team comes in and scores, the manager is
# credited with the COMBINED points of every QB from that NFL team who
# played in that game -- not just their own starter's. This cascades (a
# 3rd-string QB coming in after the backup also goes down adds their points
# too). Confirmed against a real example: league roster_id 6 (Alex), Week 1
# -- the commissioner's +19.47 `custom_points` override is exactly explained
# by a backup QB's individual score that game.
#
# This is meant to be a running, permanent LOG of every time this rule has
# actually gone into effect -- not a speculative "might this have
# happened" feed -- so it only ever logs an entry under one of two tiers:
#   "confirmed" -- the commissioner has already keyed in a `custom_points`
#     override for that roster/week. The strongest possible signal (a
#     human confirmed it), and this ALWAYS produces a log entry once an
#     override exists -- independent of whether the stats-based backup
#     detection below can identify exactly which backup(s) account for it
#     (it's best-effort for the display details, never a gate on whether
#     the event gets logged at all).
#   "likely"    -- no override yet, but at the moment this was checked
#     (live, mid-week -- or the first time the nightly job finalizes that
#     week, before the next week's practice reports reset the field) the
#     started QB's live `injury_status` read "Out"/"IR"/"PUP" AND a
#     same-team backup QB was found to have recorded real action that
#     game. `injury_status` is a live, current-only snapshot with no
#     historical record, so this is only ever captured FRESH (see
#     is_fresh below) and then carried forward permanently once captured
#     -- never re-derived from a now-stale current snapshot for an old
#     week.
# A same-team backup QB recording action with NEITHER of those two signals
# (no override, and not fresh / not ruled Out) is NOT logged at all -- it's
# exactly as likely to be a garbage-time benching as a real injury, and
# this log is meant to only contain confirmed-or-well-corroborated cases.
